# This file lets you rebind some keys to others to suit your preference or
# accessibility needs.
#
# Each line must consist of two characters separated by spaces. Whenever
# you input the first character, the game will act as if you input the
# second. Unfortunately, only printable keys are supported, e.g. you cannot
# rebind to/from the Escape or F1-F12 keys.
#
# Lines are processed in the order they appear, and characters are only
# remapped once. Empty lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.

# EXAMPLE: numberpad play 1
# If you remove the # from each of the following lines, you can perform many
# actions with the numpad
#/ d
#* t
#- a
#+ s

# EXAMPLE: numberpad play 2
#/ <
#* >
#- a
#+ s
